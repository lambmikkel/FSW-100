    <header id="header">Testing Media Queries
      Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

You can also use media queries to specify that certain styles are only for printed documents or for screen readers (mediatype: print, screen, or speech).

In addition to media types, there are also media features. Media features provide more specific details to media queries, by allowing to test for a specific feature of the user agent or display device. For example, you can apply styles to only those screens that are greater, or smaller, than a certain width.

    <div class="box box1">Every time you see 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px used as breakpoint values, a kitten gets its head bitten off by an angel…or something like that.

      The Web is inherently fluid, so it’s our job to create interfaces that look and function beautifully on any screen instead of in just a few arbitrary buckets.</div>
    <div class="box box2">As the web landscape becomes increasingly complex, it's becoming extremely important to deliver solid web experiences to a growing number of contexts. Thankfully, responsive web design gives web creators some tools for making layouts that respond to any screen size. We'll use fluid grids, flexible images and media queries to get the layout looking great regardless of the size of the device's screen dimensions.</div>
    <div class="box box3"> However, mobile context is much more than just screen size. Our mobile devices are with us wherever we go, unlocking entire new use cases. Because we constantly have our mobile devices with us, connectivity can be all over the board, ranging from strong wi-fi signals on the couch to 3G or EDGE when out and about. In addition, touch screens open new opportunities to interact directly with content and mobile ergonomics lead to different considerations when designing layout and functionality.</div>
    <footer id="foot">Footer- In order to create a site that's truly designed for mobile context and not just for small screens, we want to ensure that we tackle the many challenges of mobile development upfront. The constraints of the mobile context force us to focus on what content is essential and how to present that content as quickly as possible. Building fast-loading, optimized experiences mobile first has a trickle down (or up, depending on how you look at it) effect for tablet, desktop and other emerging contexts.</footer>
