    <p>Basketball fundamentals are very important. Fundamentals create the foundation to build more advanced skills. In my opinion, i have found that knowing the basic fundamentals can in turn make you a more reliable asset when it comes to playing basketball. This basis helps you to mkae fail safe decisions which coaches are willing to live with if that the only logical choice in a specific situation. The fundamentals of basketball are the foundation for every individual play, offensive or defensive strategy, and every move that your players make. The best players have perfected the basics of the game. Learning and mastering these basics make the rest of the game much easier!</p>

    <p>Speed is always important but never outweighs these other topics discussed. You will see through time that speed will need to become more tactical. It's great to be fast but running fast and not knowing how to utilize it properly can cost you. speed in basketball requires timing thats what makes the difference between professionals and ametuers.Basketball is an extremely dynamic sport that requires movements in multiple planes of motion as well as rapid transitions from jogging to sprinting to jumping. The ability to quickly elude defenders, rapidly decelerate to take a jump shot, or explosively jump up to grab a rebound are all skills required to effectively play the sport. </p>

    <p>Agility is one of my favorite keys. This helps with general control of the body. Helps you brain respond too certain actions that may be required to perform a specific task.Agility training improves flexibility, balance, and control.  Agility helps the body to maintain proper alignment and posture during movement. Additionally, agility drills encourage our body to learn how to maintain correct body placement. With proper agility training, sensitive areas such as the lower back, shoulders, and ankles are protected while moving quickly. </p>
