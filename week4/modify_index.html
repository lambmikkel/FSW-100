      <h2>Basketball Fundamentals</h2>

        Basketball fundamentals are very important. Fundamentals create the
        foundation to build more advanced skills. In my opinion, I have found
        that knowing the basic fundamentals can in turn make you a more reliable
        asset when it comes to playing basketball. This basis helps you to mkae
        fail safe decisions which coaches are willing to live with if that is
        the only logical choice in a specific situation. The fundamentals of
        basketball are the foundation for every individual play, offensive or
        defensive strategy, and every move that you will make. The best players
        have perfected the fundamentals of the game. Learning and mastering
        these foundational skills make the rest of the game much easier!

      <h2>Speed</h2>

      <p>
        Speed is always important but never outweighs the other topics being
        discussed on the site. You will see through experience that speed will
        need to become more tactical. It's great to be fast but running fast and
        not knowing how to utilize it properly can take away from your full
        potential. Speed in basketball requires timing. Thats what makes the
        difference between professionals and amateeurs. Basketball is an
        extremely dynamic sport that requires movements in multiple planes of
        motion as well as rapid transitions from jogging to sprinting to
        jumping. The ability to quickly elude defenders, rapidly decelerate to
        take a jump shot, or explosively jump up to grab a rebound are all
        skills required to effectively play the sport.

        Agility is one of my favorite tips. This helps with general control of
        the body. It also helps your brain respond too certain actions that may
        be required to perform a specific task.Agility training improves
        flexibility, balance, and control. Agility helps the body to maintain
        proper alignment and posture during movement. Additionally, agility
        drills encourage our body to learn how to maintain correct body
        placement. With proper agility training, sensitive areas such as the
        lower back, shoulders, and ankles are protected while moving quickly.
