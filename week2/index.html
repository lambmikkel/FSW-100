        Longwinded, running through this life like it was mine Never settling,
        but setting every goal high One thousand burpees on the path to my own
        destruction or success But what is a mistake without the lesson? See,
        the best teacher in life is your own experience None of us know who we
        are until we fail They say every man is defined by his reaction to any
        given situation Well who would you want to define you? Someone else or
        yourself? Whatever you do, homie, give your heart to it And stay strong
        -Nippsey Hussle
