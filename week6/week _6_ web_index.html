  <h1>Why is digital marketing important?</h1>
  <p>At one point online marketing was just a new and different way to market. It opened up a new form of media on which to peddle goods and services. But within just the past few years, the importance of digital marketing has become something else.
  It’s become an integral part of what a business is to its customers.
  It’s no longer enough to have a website or run some un-focused Ads campaign. Don’t have integrated digital marketing strategies working for your business? Time is working against you because of it.</p>
